# Relay

**Run all your Claude and Codex sessions from one VS Code tab.** See which session needs you, answer it in a click, and keep an eye on your plan limits without leaving the editor.

![Relay in an editor tab: sessions on the left, a Claude session on the right](img/hero.png)

Relay drives the `claude` and `codex` CLIs you already have, so your logins, settings, `CLAUDE.md` files and permission rules all still apply.

## Get started

1. Install it (needs [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) and/or [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), signed in):
   ```
   make install && make install-extension
   ```
2. Press **⌘P**, type **`> relay editor`** and pick **Relay: Open as Editor Tab**.

   <img src="img/open-tab.png" width="560" alt="Quick Open with '> relay editor' typed and Relay: Open as Editor Tab selected">

   Relay opens as a tab with two columns. Prefer it narrow? Click the Relay icon in the activity bar to use it in the sidebar.
3. Type what you want done and press **↵**.

## Features

### The right model for each message

Click the gauge next to **New** to turn on model suggestions. Then, as you type, [Jev](https://typesafe.ai) rates how hard the message looks (simple, standard or complex) and suggests a model and effort next to the model dropdown. **⇧⌘↵** sends with the suggestion. Quick fixes go to a fast model and hard problems go to the strongest one, so you don't spend your plan on a rename. By default that's Sonnet 5.5 at low effort, Opus 5.5 at medium and Opus 5.5 at high for Claude. Change them in Relay's settings.

That's for a session's first message. After that Jev keeps the session's model and suggests only the effort: low, medium or high, and xhigh for the rare hard problem that keeps failing. Switching model mid-session throws away the prompt cache and costs more than the cheaper model saves; switching effort keeps the cache.

The first time, Relay shows which model each difficulty gets, then asks for your TypeSafe API key and keeps it in the system keychain. **Relay: Set Jev API Key** changes it. The messages you type are sent to TypeSafe for the rating.

### See every session at a glance

Each session is in one of three states, so the one that needs you is always on top and old sessions don't clutter your list:

- **Working**: running, or waiting for your approval (amber).
- **Ready to review**: finished or failed while you were elsewhere. It gets a **blue dot** and stays here until you open it.
- **Complete**: you're done with it. **Complete** (top right of the chat, or the check on a card) takes it off your list. Send it another message and it comes back.

Sessions you've looked at but not completed wait under **Past** for 2 hours. **Show all past sessions** finds older ones. Forks and subsessions nest under the session they came from, and every session gets a short title that follows the conversation.

<img src="img/sessions.png" width="320" alt="The sessions list grouped into Working, Ready to review and Past"> <img src="img/unread.png" width="320" alt="Ready to review: finished sessions with blue unread dots, one failed in red">

While you're elsewhere, the activity bar badge counts what's waiting, and a notification (with a sound if VS Code isn't in front) tells you when a session finishes, fails or needs you.

### Let it run

- **Keep awake**: your Mac won't idle-sleep while an agent works.
- **Queue**: keep typing while the agent works. **↵** queues the message for when the turn ends, **⌘↵** interrupts and sends it now, **Esc** stops the agent. Queued messages wait above the box, each with **send now** and **remove**.
- **Worktree or not**: click the branch icon before the first message and the session works on its own `relay/…` branch in `~/.relay/worktrees`, leaving your project folder alone. **Complete** merges it back automatically. Leave it off and the session works in your project folder.
- **⏱ Time limit**: click the timer to set one, such as `30m`; the agent stops when it runs out.

### Scheduled tasks

The calendar turns a prompt into a session that runs daily, on weekdays, weekly or monthly. Use it for recurring chores, such as a weekly security review of what changed. Each run gets its own git worktree, and **Save and run now** lets you try it first. Tasks only run while the project is open in VS Code; a run that was missed starts once when you're back.

![A scheduled task: name, prompt, weekdays at 08:30, Claude Opus, own worktree](img/scheduled.png)

### Notes from the browser

Click the globe to open your app in Relay's own Chrome window. Press ✎ (or ⌥⇧C), click an element and say what should change. The note goes to the chat with the element's selector, a screenshot, and any console errors and failed requests. Turn on **browser access** in a chat and the agent can drive that same window to check its own work.

### From your phone

The phone icon shows a QR code. Scan it to check sessions, answer approvals, send prompts and stop agents from anywhere. The connection goes over your private [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) network, so nothing is open to the internet. Remote access turns itself off after 24 hours, or when you're back at the Mac.

### Claude and Codex, side by side

Pick the agent, model and effort for each message. The model list comes straight from each CLI, so new models show up as soon as your CLI has them. Set the mode to **Plan** to have the agent ask its questions before it writes any code, or **Ask** to get an answer without anything being changed.

![The message box with Codex, gpt-5.5, high effort and Plan mode selected](img/composer.png)

### Approvals right where you are

When an agent wants to run something that needs a person, Allow / Deny shows up on its card in the list and in the chat. File changes show their diff. Both agents run in their **auto** mode, so this only happens for the things that need you.

![An approval card: wants to run a command, npm run db:migrate, with Allow, Deny and Always allow](img/approval.png)

### Questions as buttons

When an agent asks multiple-choice questions, you get a button for each option. Pick one, or type your own answer.

![A question card with library and format options](img/questions.png)

### @ for files

Type **@** and start typing to fuzzy-search the project's files. Spaces are fine, so `comp ts` finds `src/webview/composer.ts`. **↵** or **Tab** puts the file's relative path in the message, and **Esc** closes the search. Files ignored by git are included. Dependency and cache folders such as `node_modules` and virtualenvs are left out.

### Selected code goes with your message

Select code in any editor and it shows above the message box as a chip, such as `service_policies.py (263-276)`. Send and the agent gets the file, the lines and the code after your message, as in Cursor. The **×** leaves it out. Clearing the selection or switching to another file takes it away, and once sent it isn't added again until you select something else. Very long selections send only the file and lines.

To send several, select each one and press **⌥⌘L** (or right-click → **Relay: Add Selection to Chat**). Added selections get a solid chip and stay until you send or remove them; the one you've just selected has a dashed chip.

### Plan limits at a glance

**Status** shows every limit Claude and Codex report: the 5-hour session, weekly limits, per-model limits, extra usage and credits, each with time until reset. Bars turn amber at 75% and red at 90%.

### Inspector

The bug icon shows what a Claude session loaded and how it ran: model and version, cost, what's filling the context window, CLAUDE.md and other memory files, every file touched and tool call with its timing, and events such as retries, failed hooks and compactions.

![The inspector: session setup and a context breakdown bar](img/inspector.png)

### Fork and the chat header

The header shows how full the context window is, the token counts and a run timer, next to the switches covered above. **Fork** (the last icon) branches the session off from its latest message. Hover any earlier message to fork from there instead.

![The chat header: context, tokens, a 30m time limit, tool icons and the Complete button](img/header.png)

Sessions are saved in `.relay/sessions/` in your project, so they survive reloads. They hold full transcripts, so consider adding `.relay/` to `.gitignore`.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.137 or newer. Keep awake, sound notifications and remote access are macOS-only.
- Claude Code and/or Codex, installed and signed in. Plan limits need a subscription sign-in (claude.ai, ChatGPT); with an API key, everything else still works.
- Optional: a [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai) API key for model suggestions, Google Chrome (or another Chromium browser) for browser notes, Node.js for browser access, and Tailscale on the Mac and phone for remote access.

## Settings

The gear in the sessions bar opens Relay's settings in place of the chat: model suggestions and the model for each difficulty, what new sessions start with (model, worktree, browser access), notifications, keep awake, the Plan and Ask instructions, the output format instructions, and where to find each tool. Changes save straight to VS Code's settings, so they're also under **Relay** there.

| Setting | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `relay.notifications` | `all` | `all`, `inApp` (VS Code only) or `off` (badge only). |
| `relay.keepAwake` | `true` | Keep the Mac awake while an agent works. |
| `relay.modelHints` | `false` | Suggest a model for each message with Jev. |
| `relay.modelHintModels` | | Model and effort suggested for a `simple`, `standard` or `complex` message, per provider. |
| `relay.newSessionModel` | | Provider, model and effort a new session starts with. Empty: the first model listed. |
| `relay.newSessionWorktree` | `false` | New sessions start in their own git worktree. |
| `relay.newSessionBrowser` | `false` | New sessions start with access to Relay's browser. |
| `relay.titleModel` | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Codex model that writes session titles. |
| `relay.planPrompt`, `relay.askPrompt` | | Instruction added to messages sent in Plan or Ask mode. |
| `relay.outputFormat` | `false` | Add `relay.outputFormatPrompt` to the end of every message, to control how answers are formatted. |
| `relay.claudePath`, `relay.codexPath`, `relay.chromePath`, `relay.tailscalePath` | | Where to find each tool, if Relay can't find it on its own. |
| `relay.backend` | `real` | `mock` runs fake agents with sample sessions, for working on the UI. |

## Known limitations

- Clicking the macOS notification opens Script Editor, not VS Code. Use the **Open** button in VS Code's notification.
- Only sessions started from Relay are listed, not ones you start with `claude` or `codex` in a terminal.

## Development

```
make install   # once
make run       # build, then open an Extension Development Host on this folder
make watch     # rebuild on change; reload the dev host window with ⌘R
make package   # build relay.vsix without installing it
```

Set `relay.backend` to `mock` to work on the UI without using up your plan.

- **Session rules** (unread, complete, queue, forks, time limits) live in [RealSessionsApi](src/backend/RealSessionsApi.ts). Each agent plugs in as a [ProviderAdapter](src/backend/adapter.ts): [Claude](src/backend/claude.ts) through the Agent SDK, [Codex](src/backend/codex.ts) through `codex app-server`.
- **The UI** is a webview ([src/webview](src/webview)) fed full state snapshots by [PanelHost](src/panel/PanelHost.ts). The phone gets the same UI from [src/remote](src/remote).
- **Scheduled tasks** are run by the [Scheduler](src/backend/scheduler.ts).
